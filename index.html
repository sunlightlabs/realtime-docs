<p>The base url for the API is <code>/api/</code> ; any
addresses in the below must be appended to the base url. All API calls
require an active <a href="http://services.sunlightlabs.com/accounts/register/">Sunlight API
key</a>. For instance, a call
to  would look like <code>/api/new_filing/?format=json&amp;apikey=[API key]</code>. API <a href="#methods">methods</a> and <a href="#return_types">return
types</a> are described below.</p>
<p>An interactive page that allows you to try and test live api calls is available <a href="http://tryit.sunlightfoundation.com/realtime/">here</a>. </p>
<h2 id='formats' id="formats">Formats</h2 id='formats'>
<p>The API returns results in &#39;json&#39; or &#39;csv&#39; formats. Json results are paginated and return a maximum of 100 results per page. The csv results are not paginated--only a single page of csv results is returned--and the number of rows is capped at 2,000. For larger result sets, see the <a href="http://realtime.influenceexplorer.com/download-index/">downloads page</a>. CSV results include a header row.</p>
<p>When the format is &#39;json&#39;, return objects contain top-level keys: &#39;count&#39; showing the total number of objects that match the query; &#39;next&#39;, a url for the next page of results; &#39;previous&#39; for the previous page of results. The actual result objects are returned in the &#39;results&#39; array.  </p>
