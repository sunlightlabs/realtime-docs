# Real-Time Federal Campaign Finance API


##Overview

The base url for the API is `/api/` ; any
addresses in the below must be appended to the base url. All API calls
require an active [Sunlight API
key](http://services.sunlightlabs.com/accounts/register/). For instance, a call
to  would look like `/api/new_filing/?format=json&apikey=[API key]`. API [methods](#methods) and [return
types](#return_types) are described below.

An interactive page that allows you to try and test live api calls is available [here](http://tryit.sunlightfoundation.com/realtime/). 

## Formats

The API returns results in 'json' or 'csv' formats. Json results are paginated and return a maximum of 100 results per page. The csv results are not paginated--only a single page of csv results is returned--and the number of rows is capped at 2,000. For larger result sets, see the [downloads page](http://realtime.influenceexplorer.com/download-index/). CSV results include a header row.

When the format is 'json', return objects contain top-level keys: 'count' showing the total number of objects that match the query; 'next', a url for the next page of results; 'previous' for the previous page of results. The actual result objects are returned in the 'results' array.  

    {
    "count": 88887,
    "next": "http://realtime.influenceexplorer.com/api/new_filing/?page=2&page_size=10&format=json&apikey=[APIKEY]",
    "previous": null,
    "results": [
        { â€¦
      


   
All json API calls can be given a `page` parameter to dictate the page number of the results and `page_size` parameters.

`candidate_id` : The FEC's id for the candidate connected to this committee. Only authorized committees are connected to candidates; leadership pacs are unconnected.

`committee_class` : The one letter code that describes the type of committee (see the committee reference above). Multiple committee types are allowed--a search for house and senate candidate committees would use HS, for instance.

`min_raised` : The minimum money raised. Not all electronic reports include an amount raised, so using this option will exclude all of those that do not report this figure.

`min_spent` : The minimum money spent. Not all electronic reports include an amount spent, so using this option will exclude all of those that do not report this figure.

`period_type` : The type of periodic report to include--could be monthly, quarterly or semiannual.
